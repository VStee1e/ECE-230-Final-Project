 *	LCD Display Panel Driver Routines
 *  Reference:  Refer to the Optrex LCD User Manual for all details and command formats
 *              used in these routines "Optrex LCD Manual Dmcman_full-user manual.pdf" 
 *
 *	All necessary LCD and delay functions have been bundled into this file,
 *  and the necessary function prototype statements are bundled into the 
 *  companion header file, lcd4bit.h.  Therefore by including lcd4bit.c into 
 *  a project along with a separate "main.c" program that calls one or more of these
 *  the LCD panel display routines and contains an "#include "lcd8bit.h" header file,
 *  you need not cut and paste all of these routines into the main program file itself.
 *
 *	This code will interface to a wide variety of B/W LCD Display Controllers
 *	like the Hitachi HD44780. It uses the 8-bit transfer mode, and it assumes that the
 *  pins of PORT D (RD7:0) are connected to the LCD panel, with
 *	the hardware connected as follows, assuming the standard 16 pin LCD pinout:
 
 *    Pin 1: Vss = GND
 *    Pin 2: VDD = +5V
 *    Pin3: Contrast adjustment, 5V to maximum contrast
 *    Pin 4: Register Select RS, RS=1 for command and RS=0 for data
 *    Pin 5: R/W* to be connected to GND for write only
 *    Pin 6: E or clock pin, falling edge to latch data line
 *	  Pins 7-14: LCD data bits 0-7 LCD
 *	  Pin 15: +4.2V for LED back light
 *	  Pin 16: GND for LED back light
 *	
 *	The available routines in this file are:
 *
 *    1.  lcd8bits_bits( )
 *        Always call lcd_init() first, which follows the manufacturer's
 *        directions for initializing the LCD display panel into 8-bit transfer mode.
 *        Then you may call any of the other routines, as needed.  Note that this
 *        initialization routine also makes RD7:0 all outputs, as required to drive
 *		  the LCD panel connected to RD7:0.  It also selects 8 MHz internal clock.
 *
 *    2.  lcd_clear( )
 *        Clears LCD display and homes the cursor
 *
 *	  3.  lcd_puts(const char s*)
 *        writes a constant character string to the lcd panel
 *
 *    4.  lcd_putch(char s)
 *        writes a single character to lcd panel
 *
 *    5.  lcd_goto(unsigned char pos)
 *        Moves cursor to desired position.  For 16 x 2 LCD display panel, 
 *        the columns of Row 1 are 0x00....0x10
 *        the columns of Row 2 are 0x40....0x50
 *
 *	  6.  DelayMs(unsigned int NrMs)
 *		  Delays for NrMs milliseconds.
 *
